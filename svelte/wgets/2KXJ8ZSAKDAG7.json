Lauder collection of Raphael Tuck & Sons postcards contains more than 35,000 cards produced by Raphael Tuck & Sons, a company founded in England in 1866 and in business until 1959. The company produced a wide variety of paper ephemera and played an important role in popularizing the picture postcard in Britain and America during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe company\u2019s \u201cOilettes,\u201d which were first introduced in 1903 and typically published in series, enjoyed enormous success in the first decade of the 20th century. The printing technique produced a texture resembling brush strokes, creating what Tuck described as \u201cveritable miniature oil paintings.\u201d The Oilettes were wide-ranging in their subject matter, featuring pastoral scenes, notable landmarks, architectural wonders, churches, towns, and streetscapes in Britain, the United States, and many parts of the British Empire. Some include printed descriptions of the image; others only provide space for the recipient\u2019s name, address, and postal marks.\r\n<br>\r\nThe collection provides researchers from across disciplines with a vast archive of artifacts relevant to the study of early 20th-century British and American cultural and printing history. In an era that predated television, telephone, radio, and even newspaper photography, Tuck\u2019s postcards distributed vast numbers of images quickly across huge geographical spaces, contributing to a number of cultural changes. For example, Tuck\u2019s postcards helped bring art images to popular audiences; according to the president of the Royal Arts Academy, \u201cMr. Tuck\u0027s graphic productions were likely more effective than all of the art galleries in the world\u201d in making art images accessible to millions of people at every level of society [(Source: \"History of Raphael Tuck & Sons LTD,\" TuckDB Postcards)](https://tuckdbpostcards.org/history).\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, the Oilettes helped shape ideas about Britain and its place in the world. Because many of the Oilettes featured images of far-off and often \u201cexotic\u201d locales--one subset of the collection shows ghats, mosques, palaces, and tombs near Varanasi, India, for instance--Tuck company postcards may have provided many individuals with their first impressions of the farther reaches of the British empire. Other Oilettes depicted domestic locales--provincial towns, local monuments, Scottish harbors, remote villages, and historical sites--fostering a set of conceptions among senders and recipients about what made Britain geographically and culturally distinctive. In all likelihood, the postcards also contributed to the growing popularity of tourism, ideas about fashion, notions about the relationship of city and town to country, and many other aspects of a rapidly-changing time.\r\n<\/div>","Representative":{"SystemIdentifier":"NL1M7QW","MediaEncryptedIdentifier":"2KXJ8ZI9QNAQ","Title":"Evening on the beach","MaxWidth":"3842","MaxHeight":"2496"},"Content":[{"SystemIdentifier":"NL110RD0","MediaEncryptedIdentifier":"2KXJ8ZMAZLTG","Title":"Ideal and real","CoreField.IIIFResourceType":""},{"SystemIdentifier":"NL110RD2","MediaEncryptedIdentifier":"2KXJ8ZMAZ6YL","Title":"The author","CoreField.IIIFResourceType":""},{"SystemIdentifier":"NL110RE1","MediaEncryptedIdentifier":"2KXJ8ZB2BW8Q","Title":"Tower Bridge, London","CoreField.IIIFResourceType":""},{"SystemIdentifier":"NL110RE4","MediaEncryptedIdentifier":"2KXJ8ZB2B5WO","Title":"Off deal","CoreField.IIIFResourceType":""},{"SystemIdentifier":"NL110RE7","MediaEncryptedIdentifier":"2KXJ8ZB2BP9K","Title":"Beastly funny don\u0027t cher know","CoreField.IIIFResourceType":""},{"SystemIdentifier":"NL110REH","MediaEncryptedIdentifier":"2KXJ8ZB2B037","Title":"When shepherds pen their flocks at eve in hurdled cores amid the fields secure","CoreField.IIIFResourceType":""},{"SystemIdentifier":"NL110REK","MediaEncryptedIdentifier":"2KXJ8ZB2BKI1","Title":"Cheapside, London","CoreField.IIIFResourceType":""},{"SystemIdentifier":"NL110RCJ","MediaEncryptedIdentifier":"2KXJ8ZMAIN5A","Title":"Evening on the beach","CoreField.IIIFResourceType":""},{"SystemIdentifier":"NL110RHS","MediaEncryptedIdentifier":"2KXJ8ZB2DO8P","Title":"Jeypore, Zenana carriage","CoreField.IIIFResourceType":""},{"SystemIdentifier":"NL110RL9","MediaEncryptedIdentifier":"2KXJ8ZB29KX1","Title":"The cherries.
